    Dear <strong>MDYHS Student</strong>, your Mac is behind on MacOS updates.
  </p>

  <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    Please connect to your Mac charger and click Restart Now to update your computer as soon as possible. You may click "Defer" if you are busy and want to update at a later time.
  </p>

  <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    <strong>Please note:</strong> If you run out of deferrals, your Mac will force you to restart and update, which takes about <strong>30 minutes</strong>.
    Don’t let this happen at a time when you might need to use it!
  </p>

  <p style="margin: 0;">
    Thank you,<br>
    <strong>MDYHS IT Department</strong>
